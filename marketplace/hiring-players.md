# Hiring players

Another way of acquiring players is to hire those owned by other users. To do that you'll need [$EPH](../economy/usdeph.md). When doing so you're establishing a contract between you and the player's owner to use the player for a certain amount of matches. The amount of required [$EPH](../economy/usdeph.md) is fixed by the platform and varies according to the player's OVR:

| OVR   | $EPH cost per match |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| < 70  | \~ USD 0.03125      |
| 70-75 | \~ USD 0.0625       |
| 76-81 | \~ USD 0.125        |
| 82-89 | \~ USD 0.25         |
| 90-94 | \~ USD 0.5          |
| 95-99 | \~ USD 1            |

This means that to hire a squad of 11 players for an entire season (30 matches) you'll have to invest at least \~ USD 10.
