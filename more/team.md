#### [Agu](https://agu.uy)

Iâ€™m Agu, Founder & CEO of Ephere.

I envision a world where people can work doing the thing they love. Thatâ€™s why we are building Ephere, a football game where people can play to earn. Some funâ€™t facts about me: I like stoicism, I can fly planes, I mostly use plain B/W T-Shirts (though Iâ€™m slowly changing my uniform to a more colorful version ðŸ˜œ), and Iâ€™ll go to space someday.

#### [Tico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectorituarte/)

Iâ€™m in charge of growth for this amazing universe.

Iâ€™ve been a technologist since I can remember. I became hooked on video games since the first time my elder cousins let me join them in days-long Mario Bros sessions over the holidays. I once sold a pair of Jordan sneakers so that I could afford a SNES system. But for as hard as I tried, I could never become involved in video game development â€” until now.

#### [Felipe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-collazo-70028b92/)

Hey, Iâ€™m Felipe, but you can call me Yazo. Iâ€™m Co-founder, Art Director, and Director of Awesomeness at Ephere.

When Iâ€™m not behind my desk crafting Ephereals, Iâ€™m probably out biking, watching Blade Runner for the 92nd time, or trying to communicate with a random cat I just met.

Iâ€™m also a tattoo artist, so hit me up whenever youâ€™re ready to get your Ephereal permanently inked to the side of your face.

#### [Keli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ornella-porras-7178ba224/)

Hey! I'm Keli, Ephere's Community Manager Intern. I'll be leading our Discord staff, and managing social media. I always wanted to be a rocket engineer, and actually, I kinda am, because I believe Ephere is a rocket that will fly very, very high. And I will put in all my efforts to make that happen. ðŸš€ If there's anything you need, including playing video games, please hit me up!

#### [Ren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renzodogliotti/)

I'm Ren, Sofware Engineer Intern at Ephere.

I have been in computer science for more than 10 years, an enthusiast of the blockchain world and especially of NFT games, it is a dream to be part of this project that is going to change lives.

#### [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-agustin-rodriguez/)

Hi, Iâ€™m NicolÃ¡s and Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer at Ephere.

Iâ€™ve been addicted to technology since I was young and I really enjoy learning new technologies every day. Nowadays Iâ€™m fully obsessed with blockchain and decentralization.

Dad of 2 beautiful girls, and fan of Defensores de Belgrano. Iâ€™m from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

#### [Rodri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigomelon/)

Hi! I'm Rodri and I'm a Software Engineer at Ephere, where I work with a great team crafting some cool stuff.

I'm a huge fan of Boca Juniors and football in general. I live in Buenos Aires and I try to go to the stadium whenever Boca plays at 'La Bombonera'. It's quite an experience.

I'm also a red wine lover, so you can hit me up if you have any recommendations!

#### [Santi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/santiago-rangel-mora-a71238191/)

Colombian Software Engineer with strong interests in blockchain, web3, and a decentralization believer. Also, I am in love with fractals.

I have been gaming for as long as I can remember. Hard to balance this hobby with climbing and my passion for mountaineering.

Really happy to be part of this team :smile:
