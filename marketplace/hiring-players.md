# Hiring players

Another way of acquiring players is to hire those owned by other users. To do that you'll need [$EPH](../economy/usdeph.md). When doing so you're establishing a contract between you and the player's owner to use the player for a certain amount of matches. The amount of required [$EPH](../economy/usdeph.md) is fixed by the platform and varies according to the player's OVR.
