#### [Agu](https://agu.uy)

I’m Agu, Founder & CEO of Ephere.

I envision a world where people can work doing the thing they love. That’s why we are building Ephere, a football game where people can play to earn. Some fun’t facts about me: I like stoicism, I can fly planes, I mostly use plain B/W T-Shirts (though I’m slowly changing my uniform to a more colorful version 😜), and I’ll go to space someday.

#### [Héctor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hectorituarte/)

I’m in charge of growth for this amazing universe.

I’ve been a technologist since I can remember. I became hooked on video games since the first time my elder cousins let me join them in days-long Mario Bros sessions over the holidays. I once sold a pair of Jordan sneakers so that I could afford a SNES system. But for as hard as I tried, I could never become involved in video game development — until now.

#### [Felipe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/felipe-collazo-70028b92/)

Hey, I’m Felipe, but you can call me Yazo. I’m Co-founder, Art Director, and Director of Awesomeness at Ephere.

When I’m not behind my desk crafting Ephereals, I’m probably out biking, watching Blade Runner for the 92nd time, or trying to communicate with a random cat I just met.

I’m also a tattoo artist, so hit me up whenever you’re ready to get your Ephereal permanently inked to the side of your face.

#### [Keli](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ornella-porras-7178ba224/)

Hey! I'm Keli, Ephere's Community Manager Intern. I'll be leading our Discord staff, and managing social media. I always wanted to be a rocket engineer, and actually, I kinda am, because I believe Ephere is a rocket that will fly very, very high. And I will put in all my efforts to make that happen. 🚀 If there's anything you need, including playing video games, please hit me up!

#### [Ren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/renzodogliotti/)

I'm Ren, Sofware Engineer Intern at Ephere.

I have been in computer science for more than 10 years, an enthusiast of the blockchain world and especially of NFT games, it is a dream to be part of this project that is going to change lives.

#### [Nico](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolas-agustin-rodriguez/)

Hi, I’m Nicolás and I’m a full-stack software engineer at Ephere.

I’ve been addicted to technology since I was young and I really enjoy learning new technologies every day. Nowadays I’m fully obsessed with blockchain and decentralization.

Dad of 2 beautiful girls, and fan of Defensores de Belgrano. I’m from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

#### [Rodri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigomelon/)

Hi! I'm Rodri and I'm a Software Engineer at Ephere, where I work with a great team crafting some cool stuff.

I'm a huge fan of Boca Juniors and football in general. I live in Buenos Aires and I try to go to the stadium whenever Boca plays at 'La Bombonera'. It's quite an experience.

I'm also a red wine lover, so you can hit me up if you have any recommendations!
